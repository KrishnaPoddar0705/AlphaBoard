description: Mobile UI UX Design
alwaysApply: false

PROJECT: AlphaBoard — stock-research and analyst recommendation dashboard

Primary directive:
- All UI and layout changes must be **mobile-first**, then scale upward.

Development expectations:
- Use React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS.
- Respect existing design tokens, colors, and theme.
- Conversions of tables → mobile cards MUST NOT break desktop views.
- For responsive conversions:
  - Use stacked vertical layout on `< md`
  - Hide / collapse panels using `hidden md:block`
  - Use tabs, accordions, or bottom sheets for secondary content

Component rules:
- Any UI refactor must remain **modular**:
  - Extract `MobileNavBar`, `IdeaListCardMobile`, etc where needed.
  - Never dump >300 LOC in a single component; break it up.

Refactor rules:
- Before large changes, Cursor must propose a plan and wait for approval.
- Cursor must output:
  - list of files it will change
  - summary of UI UX improvements
  - risk notes (if any)

Diff formatting rules:
- Use unified diff (`diff`) or copy-paste component replacements
- Annotate lines you add/remove when unclear
- Never hide important code changes

Behavior rules:
- Cursor must treat mobile UX as THE priority:
  - shrink headers, remove wasted space
  - ensure above-the-fold content shows key metrics immediately
  - ensure interactive controls are thumb-reachable
- Cursor must test viewport visually (via explanation) after changes:
  - e.g., “On 390px width, result = no horizontal scroll”

Forbidden:
- No random rewrites or redesigns without approval
- No new libraries added without explicit user permission
- No altering backend logic / recommendation math

If uncertain:
- Cursor must ask: “Confirm before applying?” and wait.
